slipgate-bug
============
I was heading toward the Def slipgate in Reg, and it said the following in chat:
[15:31:20] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [ALERT]Entering slipgate to Defalos!
[15:31:20] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Your autopilot has turned off.
[15:31:20] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] You have released your craft.
[15:31:20] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] The ship has been released, you are no longer riding on it.
[15:31:20] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [Space] You are now Suffocating!
My ship and inventory despawned, and I was left in front of the slipgate, suffocating. I died and spawned on Boletarian.
The reason for spawning on Bole is likely because I set my bed home there when I was on a trip with Dragoth earlier and
didn't update it.
